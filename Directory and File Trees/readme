Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was really hard but definitely helpful in learning debugging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was very tedious and I had to work on catching small details. It was 
a very difficult assignment. However, I was able to learn a lot. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

We do not think there is any bugs. We decided to have three types of 
nodes, files, directories, and general nodes in order to decrease the 
number of duplicate functions in nodeFT.

What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

// Since the disagrement with all the warnings are the same, I will
   just note it after all the warnings.

the warning does not apply.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert 
                        (it doesn't check that the BDT is initialized)
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2       BDT_freeSubtree 
                        (it forgets to make child 2 into child 1 
                        after removing child 1))
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3       BDT_addChild 
                        (it sets psParent->psChild1 = psParent->psChild1
                         or psParent->psChild2 = psParent->psChild2 
                         instead of setting sParent->psChild1 = psChild 
                         or psParent->psChild2 = psChild, respectively.)
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4       BDT_strlenAccumulate 
                        (it doesn't add one additional byte ('\n') 
                        to the sum as described in the comments)
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5       BDT_findNode 
                        (if (Path_comparePath(BDT_getPath(psFound), 
                        oPPath)!=0) it forgets to call 
                        Path_free(oPPath); before returning 
                        NO_SUCH_PATH)

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

dynaarray.h
 - since we are considering the growing array, there is no need to have
   length as an argument of DynArray_new
 - DynArray_search is probably using linear search in contrast to 
   bsearch, so the name should be DynArray_lsearch
path.h
 - Path_dup is not necessary since we can use Path_prefix and 
   Path_getDepth to obtain the copy
 - Path_getStrLength is not necessary since we can use strlen and 
   Path_getPathname to obtain the length of the string representation
nodeDTGood.c
 - Node_new does not check if there is already a root when 
   oParent == NULL
