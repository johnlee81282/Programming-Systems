Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was more difficult to debug than C but helped my understanding on 
the material a lot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was a lot of new material as we delved into assembly language 
which is very different from C programming. 
It was tedious but I learned a lot.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

bigintaddoptopt.s sometimes beats the compiler and sometimes not.

What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary Tests:
mywc_boundary_consecutive_newline.txt: 
    This file consists of a sentence followed by multiple consecutive 
    newlines followed by another sentence. This tests whether having 
    x consecutive newlines will increase the line count by exactly 
    x amount. 
mywc_boundary_newline_character.txt: 
    This file consits of 10 consecutive newlines with no other 
    characters. This is to test whether the newline is counted as a 
    character (so in the output, the line count and character count 
    should be equal).
mywc_boundary_consecutive_spaces.txt: 
    This file consists of a setence followed by a newline followed by 
    first half of the 2nd sentence followed by multiple consecutive 
    spaces followed by the second half of the second sentence. 
    This test is to verify that the program does not increase the 
    number of words when multiple consecutive spaces are present.
mywc_boundary_blank.txt: 
    This file is a blank file. This is to test if the program outputs 
    0 lines, 0 words, 0 characters (initial value for all new empty 
    files).
mywc_boundary_only_word.txt: 
    This file only consists of one word and nothing else (no space at 
    the end). This is to verify that the program increases the word 
    count even if the word has not ended (space was not pressed after 
    the word).
mywc_boundary_spaces.txt:
    This file only consists of ten spaces and a new line at the end of 
    the file. This is to verify that the program does not increase 
    word count if there is no nonspace character.

Statement Tests:
mywc_statement_lCharCount.txt: 
    This file consists of one "word". It tests if lCharCount increases 
    for every character (excluding '\0'). It causes the computer to 
    execute line 32, 45, 53, 55 in mywc.c.
mywc_statement_lWordCount.txt: 
    This file consists of sentences, newline characters, multiple 
    consecutive spaces, and tab characters. It tests if lWordCount 
    increases if the character is a whitespace character right after 
    a non-whitespace character. Any whitespace character that comes 
    after the first space whitespace character does not increase 
    lWordCount. \t and \n counts as one whitespace character. 
    It causes the computer to execute line 32, 38, 39, 45, 49, 55.
mywc_statement_whitespace_word_newline.txt: 
    This file consists of words scattered due to newlines. It tests to 
    cover whtiespace transitions, word detections, and newline 
    detections. It causes the computer to execute line 32, 38, 39, 45, 
    49, 53, 55 in mywc.c.
mywc_statement_long_line.txt: 
    This file consists of 1000 single-character words with a space that 
    follows each word. It tests to see if the program can handla very 
    long line without a newline. It causes the computer to execute line 
    32, 38, 39, 45, 55.
mywc_statement_whitespace_newline.txt: 
    This file consists of one word followed by a space followed by a 
    newline. It tests to verify that the program recognizes a space 
    followed by a newline (both are whitespaces). It causes the computer
    to execute lines 32, 38, 39, 44, 49, 55.

Stress Tests:
mywc_stress_line_character.txt: 
    This file consists of 1000 lines with 50 non-whitespace characters 
    per line. It tests the upper bound of allowed file size.
mywc_stress_character.txt: 
    This file consists of 50000 non-whitespace characters. This tests 
    to see if a very long word is counted as a single word. 
mywc_stress_random.txt:
    This file consists of 10000 pseudo random integers without any space
    inbetween. It tests that it can read a large number of 
    random sequence of integers.
