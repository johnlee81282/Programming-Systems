# Programming-Systems
This repository contains selected projects completed as part of Princeton
University’s Introduction to Programming Systems course.

The projects focus on systems-level programming in C, emphasizing both
high-level program structure and low-level implementation details.

Each project includes only the files necessary to understand the core design
and implementation of the assignment. Auxiliary files not essential to the
project have been omitted.

Some files were provided as part of the course infrastructure; only the
student-implemented components reflect my original work.

## Notes

These projects were completed as coursework. Problem statements and full
assignment specifications are available on the course website:
