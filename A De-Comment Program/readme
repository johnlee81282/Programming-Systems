What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I was able to have a stronger foundation of the source code, preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker.
It was a very helpful assignment that challenged me enough. I ran out of time so I was not able to approach the 
challenge question but it was still fun overall!
